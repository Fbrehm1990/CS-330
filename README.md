1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Before this course I had no previous experience with using OpenGL or any type of graphical interface. This course and project have helped me in developing skills in creating, sizing, and positioning objects in a scene. I have learned how to apply textures, shaders, and lighting to scenes as well as how to prepare and render the scene with all of those components applied. My design process was simple, as I organized each section according to wether it had to do with lighting, textures, shading, or objects. Once organized I added the code for each in order to produce a finished scene with all of the elements included. I can utilize these tactics from my design approach from the project in future projects as well. I find the simplest way to be successful is to be organized while having a plan. Using this method as well as resources and consistent testing would be applied in any future work and would make me successful in my designs, no matter what they are.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

One of the new development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene was to develop each step of the scene individually. First I would focus on the objects themselves and where to place them and how to scale them. After this I focused on the actual texturing and shading of the objects. Last I focused on the lighting of the scene. Throughout each phase I was constantly testing to ensure that the scene looked how I needed it too. Iteration was huge in the role of my scene as I would perform testing after every edit that I made. This helped in ensuring that I made the proper edits and that they looked exactly how I wanted it too. Throughout the milestones my development approach changed gradually. When I first started the milestones I was unsure of how to go about producing the code and developing it. I would go back and forth in randomness while trying to write the code and make edits. However as I continued to develop the code throughout each milestone I began to understand how I could organize and ultimately create an approach that helped me create my scene.

4. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I have always been extremely intrigued by CGI in movies as well as video games. I was very excited when I found out this course involved computational grapics and visualizations as one career pathway I have always been interested in is CGI in cinemas as well as the video game graphics. This course helps me achieve a beginning understanding of how computational graphics and visualizations creates the scenes involved in these areas. Computational graphics and visualization gave me the knowledge and skills to be able to go forward and build on the skills that I developed in this course in order for me to dive into a career that will allow me to work directly in this field.
