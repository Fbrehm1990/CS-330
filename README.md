1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Before this course I had no previous experience with using OpenGL or any type of graphical interface. This course and project have helped me in developing skills in creating, sizing, and positioning objects in a scene. I have learned how to apply textures, shaders, and lighting to scenes as well as how to prepare and render the scene with all of those components applied. My design process was simple, as I organized each section according to wether it had to do with lighting, textures, shading, or objects. Once organized I added the code for each in order to produce a finished scene with all of the elements included. I can utilize these tactics from my design approach from the project in future projects as well. I find the simplest way to be successful is to be organized while having a plan. Using this method as well as resources and consistent testing would be applied in any future work and would make me successful in my designs, no matter what they are.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
